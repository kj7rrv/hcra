# HCRA Client

This is the client for HCRA. It connects to a running instance of HCRA Server
(see `../server`).

## Installation

Just use your favorite static-site Web server. You may, optionally, delete
this file, but it shouldn't hurt anything to leave it.

## Usage

Enter the server URL (starts with `ws://` or `wss://`) and password, then
click Start.

## Mobile

This should work on mobile devices. Use landscape orientation for best
results.
